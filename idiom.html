	<section class="poem"> Belly down on my board- <br/>
	Like a drunk-<br/>
Doubled over laughing, <br/>
Bursting at the seams. <br/>
Because the ocean got me <br/>
Once again. <br/>
In my ecstasy, <br/>
a tear rolled down <br/>
My neck. My <br/>
Mouth went to get it back; <br/>
drank the whole ocean instead. </section>

		<section class="title2"> You Used To Take Me Dancing </section>

	<section class="author"> // Andrew York </section>
	<section class="poem"> You used to take me dancing, and in the wild lights of the discotheque you would watch me close my eyes and lose myself. I would feel you tight, plunged against me; we could become an ocean, or lungs, or anything we wanted.
<br/> <br/>
But suddenly you didn’t like ‘sweating to pulsing rhythms,’ as you called it. You were a man who worked with your hands, after all. You would order your beer, hunched over—weary—and watch from your stool at the bar. To you, fun was shooting cans or cats on tree stumps, jacking off in the porta-potty at work. 
<br/> <br/>
You did love me when I was all buzzed out from loud music and alcohol; you were all business then. Sometimes in my living room, sometimes in your bedroom, but usually in the car and once in the alley behind the club.
<br/> <br/>
You used to take me dancing, but now you just take me.</section>

	<section class="poem"> My stomach ties itself in a knot for <br/>
the way you eat your apple,<br/>
in one bite like a bear or something<br/>
without leaving any for me<br/>
(though I didn’t ask you to).<br/>
And I wonder what it is<br/>
to take without collapsing in on yourself,<br/>
to exist without mumbling apologies<br/>
to trees and skies and billboards,<br/>
and to rise in the morning without shame<br/>
and eat another piece of fruit (an apple or whatever).<br/>
And I wonder how it is to be<br/>
solid like those pictures of cowboys<br/>
or Amelia Earhart somewhere<br/>
sinking into the ocean.<br/>
And yes, she’s gone now<br/>
but at least she was flesh and bone.</section>

	<section class="author"> // Jonathan Chandra </section>
	<section class="poem"> When we first meet, I reach my hand out like you’re supposed to do when you meet someone new. Her answer is a thin smile, and then: a careful extension of three fingers that ever-so-lightly grasp my outstretched hand. I smile back, but now she is looking out the window and does not see. I swallow the lump in my throat. <br/>
<br/>
Months later, looking at the strange shadows on the ceiling instead of her, I ask her why. Through the side of my head, I can feel her staring at me, then hear the metal cord go shink as she turns on the bedside lamp. She turns to face me and when our eyes meet she looks more serious than I expected, more serious than she has ever been. She breaks her gaze now, and her eyes travel around the room as if they’re searching, searching for something, and then snap back into place. She breathes once, very softly, and whispers: Every man I dated was a snake. She squirms under the sheets. And so I hold my lovers loosely. I reach for her hand and she takes it, clinging on softly with three fingers: pointer, middle, thumb. But only for a moment. She lets go of me with a sigh and turns her body away from me, pulling light green covers up past her bare shoulders and over her curly head. That way I can drop them before they bite. I wonder if I am dreaming and then I think to myself that we weren’t lovers when we first met, we only worked together. I say it out loud without realizing, I guess, because she responds. Not lovers, she repeats, voice muffled under green. But weren’t we, on some level? In the beginning. On the meta-physical, asexual plane. I shake my head, confused, but she is hidden under covers and cannot see it. I sound strange, don’t I? I know I do, I know I do, but I’m saying what I feel right now. I reach my arms out to hold her, hug her tightly over the covers. I tell her that I love her, and how much. I love you as well, darling. See, you’re different. I think I’ve always loved you. I smile and know that something is very wrong. Holding her through green covers, I wonder aloud if she thinks I am a snake as well. I love you as well, darling. She sounds like a recording. You’re so different. I think I’ve always loved you. She sighs, pulls the sheets back from her face, looks at me.<br/>
<br/>
And then: she sighs a bright pink sigh that stays stuck to her lips and grows like a gum-bubble that never pops. It stretches outward and upward like a strange balloon, she begins to rise. The sheets fall past her shoulders, down past her shoulders, her thighs, knees, toes. I reach up to catch her but she is leaving me too fast, rising on a pink sigh, and I am left with a fistful of green. I tremble. Are these tears on my cheek?<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, she is still gone. I breathe in the covers and they smell freshly washed. I pull the white sheets down past my face and breathe again, deep through the nose. Even the smell of her has gone away. On the way to work, where we used to work together, I try to convince myself that I’m over her. I’m over her. I squirm past people on crowded sidewalks and curl around the scaffolding of buildings under construction. I’m here. But as I glide up the steps to the office, I realize all of a sudden that I have no limbs, that I am crawling on my belly.</section>

		<section class="title2"> Things That Keep Me Up At Night </section>

	<section class="author"> // Rachel Pacitti </section>
	<section class="poem"> Hip fat and back rolls, and debt, and getting walked in on in the bathroom, and nose pimples, and the snap of latex gloves, and when you’re in a lake and you see a fish go by and you feel like it’s staring at you but you know it’s probably not, <br/> <br/>
And jeans that won’t go over the thigh, and rude waiters, and Aunt Janice who kisses on the lips, and prolonged farewells, and nurses who can’t find veins, and truck drivers, and flying cockroaches, and men without dogs in the woods, <br/> <br/>
And undercooking chicken, and accidentally clogging a toilet, and straggling behind an acquaintance that hasn’t noticed you, and receiving visitors wearing only a flimsy green gown, <br/> <br/>
And swimming through seaweed, and being put on What Not to Wear, and merging without acceleration lanes, and the sounds of hospitals at night, <br/> <br/>
The shuffling slipper feet, the hum of breathing machines, the red
haired lady in the bed over <br/>
singing in her sleep. </section>
